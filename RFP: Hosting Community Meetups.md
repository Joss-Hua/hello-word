- Meetups where the aim is to test general implementation of filecoin, file issues for any problems that arise, and fix some of them
- Bug bashes (fix some of the open Filecoin Venus issues)
- Meetups focused on explaining the key differences in the implementation of filecoin
- AMA mainly solves miners' questions about Filecoin protocol, economic, proof, EC, implementation and deployment
- Filecoin miner offline summit aimed at mutual exchange, learning, putting forward ideas and sharing experience
- Workshops specializing in how to build an app on Filecoin

Please follow the same general instructions as described in the [README for the general RFP proposals](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants#submit-a-proposal-for-an-rfp) (i.e. submit a PR, tag it properly, etc.).

## Value

Community events can be an extremely powerful, galvanizing force for an open-source project. Due to geographical location, we are unable to organize high-quality community activities for global communities. We would love to engage our community members to help in this process, increasing the number of people who are deeply invested in and committed to the success of the Filecoin project.

## Deliverables

- Event logistics plan (including schedule of activities, venue, theme and speakers, ticket/RSVP link. etc.)
- Summarized post-event report (including what went well at this event, what could have been improved, and feedback from attendees)
- Photos and recordings from the event posted publicly online

## Recommended Team

- Miner and event organizers would be the perfect fit for this sort of project
- Developers who are excited about Filecoin would also be a great fit!

## Detailed Requirements & Constraints

- The purpose of the event can be discussed with Venus team first
- Event must be publicly marketed
- Event must have some photos or recording (doesn't need to be extensive, just need some proof that the event occurred as intended)
