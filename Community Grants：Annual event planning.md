## Event Purpose:** Encourage Filecoin ecosystem participants to participate in and use Filecoin and its common implementations

## Event Description

Venus team will organize different types of events to promote the Filecoin ecosystem, encourage community members to join and build a strong and resilent  Filecoin community.

**Types of events**

Offline Events:Community Meetup, Distributed Storage Summit, Filecoin Developer Camp, Filecoin miners conference, Hackathon etc.
Online Events: AMAs,Panels, Meetups with deveopers and community members (Jointly organize with media or communities). 

**Cost of events**

Holding events requires fees to cover venue, branding&marketing, materials, refreshments or other costs. We plan to control the number of participants in each activity from 50-500 (according to the actual needs). The events will also be shared through live broadcast (considering whether to keep the video according to the situation of the meeting), and there will be event reports, including the release of the event schedule, event review, community interactions, etc.

Venus team hope to organize or participate events with Protocol Labs & Filecoin Foundation like Filecoin ecological summit, Web3 conference, Summer Camp.
In addition, Venus will hold events independently or with partners like blockchain meidias and communities together.

Filecoin miners, developers and builders in the Asia Pacific region(regional convenient) or overseas will be invited as guests to bring valuable sharings and ideas to Filecoin ecological builders in the Asia Pacific region based on the progress of projects in different stages of Venus or the latest development of Filecoin ecology.

Finally, we hope that people from more regions will participate in Filecoin ecosystem & community more deeply, including Filecoin implementations development, providing storage services, DAPP building and so on.

## Value

All the planned events will bring more comprehensive, timely and correct information and guidance to all kinds of Filecoin ecosystem participants, and promote the balanced development of Filecoin four different implementations. 
In this process, more and more people( including developers, miners, customers and application service providers) will learn more and join the Filecoin ecosystem to develop, contribute and co-build a larger and resilent Filecoin ecosystem or community.

## Request of support

The events is a long-term plan(started with half a year) and we need financial support to do so. We can get part of the funding by way of sponsorship, but it's uncertain.

# Additional Information

Venus has released the latest version to support Distributed Mining Pool( **small and medium miners friendly**), and has run the **first distributed mining pool** on the Filecoin Mainnet. 
At present, the Venus distributed mining pool has joined with 5 miners at least, and more miners are using Venus to test and deploy in the Filecoin network. 
With more participants and developers come and use Venus,  that does great help to make huge progress to bring  more people to participate in the various contributions of Venus and Filecoin, so as to make the general implementation of Filecoin develop in a balanced way and make it easier for small and medium-sized miners to join.
